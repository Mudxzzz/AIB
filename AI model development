## AIB session 1 7th july

AI is a branch of CS taht works to empower machines to imitate the humar intelligence.
Intellegence is the quality that helps something to acquire the knowledge from past experiences and use this in making decisions or new circumstances.
Not all AI models will have learning capabilties.
Blockchain - decentralised computing.
Models - frameworks with multiple alogrithms, depending upon the complexity.
GPT - Gentrative Pre-trained transformer.
1st gen vacume tubes, 2nd transisters, 3rd IC, 4th VLSI/ULSI, 5th AI.

AI in investment - Riskiest and unuseful inventments in the world.
Before 2019, AI in busniess was a luxury not a priority, better now.
AI Model is a program hat has been trined on data to recognize ceration patterns or make certain decisions without futher human intervention.
AI models apply different alogrithms to relevent data inputs to achieve the tasks, or output, they've been proggrammed form.
Defined by its abilty to autonomusly make decisions of predictions, rather that simulate hinam intelligence.
ML is a party of AI.

Pure AI - robotics arms in factories. are called symbolic AI.
Sequence of if, then, else commands with rules programed explicitly by a data scientist.

Types of models - Genrative and discriminative.
Generative models - work on 'joint probabilty , work on unsupervised learning.
supervised learning - known input and outputs, unsupervised learning - machine learning models are given unlabeled data and allowed to discover patterns and insights without any explicit guidance or instruction.

Affinity group analysis -   a technique that organizes qualitative data into categories based on shared themes or attributes. why clusters? *course *football lovers *gender *language *hobbies *region *  

##  POWER BI

Catogrised data = pie chart 

ASsignemnt 1 - select a dataset from kagle or data.ai or github and prepare the forst dashboard, identify problem areas and develope insights.

## crafting AI skills - Guest lecture

automation - deterministic sysetem.
autonomous - probabilistic , based on context.

RAGs - Retrival automated Generation, 

Google vertex - 
use the Vertex Al SDK for Python, make sure that the service account initializing the client has the Vertex Al Service Agent (roles/aiplatform.serviceAgent) IAM role

Open Cloud Shell. Cloud Shell is an interactive shell environment for Google Cloud that lets you manage your projects and resources from your web browser.

In the Cloud Shell, set the current project to your Google Cloud project ID and store it in the projectid shell variable:

Enable the IAM, Compute Engine, Notebooks, Cloud Storage, and Vertex Al APIs.

## POWER QUERY EDITOR

-> transform data
-> first row get sensed as headers ot do mannualy
-> Split data using delimiters 
-> change data type in trasform
-> 

NORMALISATION in excel
splitting lage data into smaller unoits to ensure minimum data duplicacy and engancing data intigrity, 

Data in PowerBI

1. Ensurting primary Key in all tables this attribute should be NOT NULL and UNIQUE.
2. Identifieng the relevent foriegn key.
3. data integrity constraints - 
    a) data insertion contaraints 
    b) data updation constraints
    c) data deletion constraints


Automatic - predicted a finite number of situations and defined their reponses, accordingly we programe the system. IF THEN ELSE statement
Autonomous - we train the system fro finte number of situations and responses but the system will keep updating its knowledgebase under every new circumstances. Learning model

False AI is a system which is automatic that is trained with a large number of if, then, else.
True AI are the systems which are trained with finite number of situation and responses but keep updating itself.

AI lifecycle:

Design 
Deploy
Develop

NVivo - qualitative data research : NCapture- extension, capture webpage and analyse the text in nvivo 

chrome extension - web scrapping, can use in python

Data Wrangling - convert data from raw form to desired data form.
evaluation - accuracy of the model.

move to production - 

1- identifying the business problem 
2- what processes are in use to solve this problem ?
3- how do you se AI improving current process?
4- what are the KPIs that will help you track progress?
5- What resources will be required ?
6- how to break the problem into iterative sprints?

Problem categories 
Classification - into type A or B, using clustering.
Regression - predict defined number with defined parameters, Linear Regression.
Recommendation - identifying patterns, 

Decision tree, used when data set has more than 1 independent variable and there is a combination of decision trees possible so we calculate average of the outcomes for multiple decision trees for making predication, this is called random forest. 

Logistic Regression- the situations where outcome variable of the dependent variable can have only 2 starts then we apply log reg.
Ex- on x axis - no of interaction with the customer , y axis - sales done or not done. outcome in form of binary.


Ethical Issues in AI :
Algorithemic bias -  Bias due to training, 
Socio-econimc inequality - services offered are different due to geo factors, Licencing rights,  
Data privacy - 

Laws of robotics, 
site : deepmind-safety and ethics

GPU - Graphics processing units
FPGA - sealed programmable gate arrays.
