## AIB session 1 7th july

AI is a branch of CS taht works to empower machines to imitate the humar intelligence.
Intellegence is the quality that helps something to acquire the knowledge from past experiences and use this in making decisions or new circumstances.
Not all AI models will have learning capabilties.
Blockchain - decentralised computing.
Models - frameworks with multiple alogrithms, depending upon the complexity.
GPT - Gentrative Pre-trained transformer.
1st gen vacume tubes, 2nd transisters, 3rd IC, 4th VLSI/ULSI, 5th AI.

AI in investment - Riskiest and unuseful inventments in the world.
Before 2019, AI in busniess was a luxury not a priority, better now.
AI Model is a program hat has been trined on data to recognize ceration patterns or make certain decisions without futher human intervention.
AI models apply different alogrithms to relevent data inputs to achieve the tasks, or output, they've been proggrammed form.
Defined by its abilty to autonomusly make decisions of predictions, rather that simulate hinam intelligence.
ML is a party of AI.

Pure AI - robotics arms in factories. are called symbolic AI.
Sequence of if, then, else commands with rules programed explicitly by a data scientist.

Types of models - Genrative and discriminative.
Generative models - work on 'joint probabilty , work on unsupervised learning.
supervised learning - known input and outputs, unsupervised learning - machine learning models are given unlabeled data and allowed to discover patterns and insights without any explicit guidance or instruction.

Affinity group analysis -   a technique that organizes qualitative data into categories based on shared themes or attributes. why clusters? *course *football lovers *gender *language *hobbies *region *
